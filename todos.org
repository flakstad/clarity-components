  testytest
:END:
New feature "note" with underline "n", keybinding "n". Opens a popup with a
textarea field to add data, buttons so save and cancel. Also saves on Enter,
cancels on Escape. Like the due on popup but with a textarea instead of date
selector. Emits event on save.
* DONE feature to remove item from outline
CLOSED: [2025-09-01 Mon 10:33]
New feature "remove" with underline "r", keybinding "r". Opens a popup with a
confirmation question "Remove?" and buttons "Remove" and "Cancel", which also
triggers by Enter and Escape.
* DONE default colors more subtle, completed items color gray? Something less vibrant than pink for TODOs.
CLOSED: [2025-09-01 Mon 10:48]
More elegant, toned down.
* DONE "open", "status", "edit", "remove" should come first - then others
CLOSED: [2025-09-01 Mon 11:02]
* DONE the child counter does not work initially if the parent does not have a status label
CLOSED: [2025-09-01 Mon 11:10]
When indenting, the counter is not shown if the parent is a "heading", that is it does not have a status label.
Even headings should have the counter for the number of children tasks.
It works if it first has a label like TODO, then I indent a child, and then remove the status label again.
* DONE blog post
CLOSED: [2025-09-01 Mon 13:58]
Let's see if cursor manages to create a new blog post for me with the js

worst.
